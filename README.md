# -Health-Hospital-Work-and-Leads-Workflow-Dashboard

## Overview:
I’ve been working on a Power BI dashboard that focuses on optimizing health and hospital operations, specifically targeting workflow efficiencies in lead management. This project allowed me to dive deep into the complexities of healthcare data, aiming to provide actionable insights that can help improve patient care and streamline hospital processes.

#  Key Highlights:

Comprehensive Data Visualization: Interactive charts and graphs that provide a clear overview of key performance indicators (KPIs).

Lead Workflow Optimization: Analysis of lead generation and management to enhance hospital outreach and patient acquisition.

Performance Metrics: Tracking vital statistics to ensure hospitals can maintain high standards of care.

I’m passionate about using data to drive better decision-making in the healthcare sector, and I’m excited about the potential impact of this dashboard.
